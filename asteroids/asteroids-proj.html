    <h1>Asteroids</h1>
    <p>
      I made a recreation of 1979's famous Asteroids game!
      Come take a look at what I learned and how I worked through
      the problems I came across.

    <h2>Project purpose and goal</h2>
    <p>
      My purpose for this project was to learn about HTML Canvas and get more experience with
      object-oriented programming. It was my first time using canvas and also my first time 
      developing a game. I wanted to strengthen my chops with vanilla JavaScript and get 
      some practice with writing organized, well-structured code. As the project was my first
      introduction to concepts such as a game loop and drawing using geometry/trigonometry, I 
      followed a tutorial to initially complete this project before refactoring the code and 
      adding some features of my own, such as the ship's aiming beam and a special aiming mode
      for the ship to make the game a little bit less tedious to play by modern standards.
    </p>
    <h2>Technologies and explanation</h2>
    <p>
      This project uses vanilla JavaScript and HTML Canvas as well as CSS and HTML. As the
      focus of this project was improving my skills with plain JS and getting some chops
      with programming logic, I didn't use a framework to develop this project.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems and thought process</h2>
    <p>
      I came across a few different problems while trying to get this project working. One of
      the first was trying to make the ship longer than it was in the tutorial, for which I
      needed to try to understand the trigonometry used to draw the ship's triangular path
      on the canvas. Another problem I had was with positioning the game text, which I solved
      by using getBoundingClientRect to accurately position the "new level" and "game over"
      messages over the center of the canvas. I also made use of the localStorage API to keep
      track of the player's high score and the Sound API for sound effects.
