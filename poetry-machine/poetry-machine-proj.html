    <h1>Poetry Machine</h1>
    <p>
      I made a web application that writes out famous poems
      across the screen! Come take a look at what I learned
      and how I worked through the problems I came across.

    <h2>Project purpose and goal</h2>
    <p>
      I was inspired to make this project after coming across <a href="https://poetrydb.org/index.html" target="_blank">PoetryDB</a>.
      I wanted to make a web app that makes calls to the PoetryDB API and uses a
      typing function to "type out" a poem onto the page. I developed this project
      using functional components in React. The app enables users to get a random
      poem or search for an author in the database. I also created a "Madlibs" mode
      using Promise.all that allows the user to generate a poem with random lines
      from between 1 and 8 randomly chosen poems.
    </p>
    <h2>Technologies and explanation</h2>
    <p>
      I originally had made a version of this project using imperative
      programming and vanilla JavaScript, but after learning React I
      decided it would be exactly the kind of project that would benefit
      from using React's declarative-based UI style. I used functional
      components and conditional rendering to display a different UI for
      each different "mode" of the app (which I kept in state). I made use
      of useState, useEffect, useRef, and useCallback in this project. I
      enjoyed using React quite a bit and immediately found why it's
      useful for developing UIs that have a lot of moving parts.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems and thought process</h2>
    <p>
      As this was the first web app of my own that I've made using React,
      I got the chance to apply what I had learned from studying the docs
      and doing tutorial projects. One problem I ran into occured because
      I didn't have ESLint installed to verify the dependencies in my
      useEffect dependency array, but actually wound up teaching me a lot
      about how closures work in the context of React and React's rendering
      logic. Inside of my useEffect, I was calling a function without including
      it in the dependency array. I neglected to consider that the function
      at the top level of my component would be re-declared every time the
      component rendered, and that this would cause the function captured in
      my useEffect to have a stale closure over a state variable that it used.
      <br><br>
      It was a complicated problem that had a simple solution (declare the
      function with useCallback and put it inside the useEffect's dependency
      array) but I was actually glad I didn't have ESLint installed and had
      to understand what was happening myself. It gave me a deeper understanding
      of what was going on, and thankfully now it's something I won't have
      to go through again!
